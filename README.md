# Online-Billing-System
This is a web application or portal tailored for educational institutions. The code includes features for user authentication, a dashboard with various menu items, and forms for data entry (e.g., external exam details, user registration). The styling modifications involve creating a responsive and visually appealing dashboard interface.
The dashboard includes features such as user authentication, a sidebar navigation menu with various options like Dashboard, Paper Setting, Answer Sheet Evaluation, Practical Exam Conduction, and Visiting Faculty. Additionally, we have implemented a toggle functionality for the sidebar and a logout button. The goal is to store user-submitted data in a database, using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the development.
